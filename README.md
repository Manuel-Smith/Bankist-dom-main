# bankist-dom-page

## About
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate visual components and effects that require advance DOM manipulation techniques. The site is a mockup of a marketing website of a fictional bank. This project is part of "The Complete JavaScript Course" that is taught by Jonas Schmedtmann. The HTML and CSS are already provided by Schmedtmann and the Javascript work is done by me.
